    "&gt; in crises like pandemics, isn‚Äôt some level of centralized coordination necessary? the key here is that it's decentralized _preparation_ See the story: almost all of the hard work was done before the pandemic even started",

    "Some weird bug causes my laptop to consume 25 watts when the ollama server is turned on, even when it's not used. So I had to add keyboard shortcuts to turn the server on and off quickly, which is annoying. Also, lmstudio seems to have more features, I'm checking out doing stuff‚Ä¶",
    "Wrote a draft for a blog post, gave various feedback to deep funding people and based rollup people, visited various family members, moved my local AI setup from ollama to lmstudio, figured out how to write android apps, walked 45km, ran 4 how about you? üòä",
    "I admire your willingness to stand up and fight for freer movement of people, it's an important freedom that all too easily gets thrown under the bus. That said I think it's valuable to turn down the temperature here, on both tone of discourse and the social media banhammer.‚Ä¶",
    "Social incentive is fine. I mean an incentive to nominate good jurors instead of bad jurors (and, nominate people who nominate people ... who are good jurors instead of bad jurors)",
    "I wonder if there are benefits to adding any type of incentive alignment on juror recommendation. So far we've been treating the jury as the top-level \"unincentivized incentivizer\" but as it scales and we get like 7 levels of indirection that may start to crack in some way.",
    "1975-99 winning for \"least eventful\" puzzles me deeply. Birth of the internet, end of the USSR, fastest period of economic growth for East Asia... Feels much more significant than 1950-74.",
    "I can confirm that recently I've been pivoting more and more from starbucks to chatime. Starbucks in many places is moving toward not even having tea as an option (!!) and even when it does, chatime tea (like, their plain hot tea, no milk/sugar) is so much better.",
    "He should have gone to Vancouver, it slightly outperforms the Netherlands on climate.",
    "The discounting reflects the degree of uncertainty that any plan you make to affect the future will actually work, and will not be rendered useless or superfluous by other changes that happen within that time.",
    "The big delta between now and full-AGI is realistically the ability to handle exceptional-case situations (eg. stuff breaks and needs to be repaired, and that type of repair has never been done before, you run out of some resource and need to come up with a substitute, etc)",
    "It just requires the ability to run and maintain factories, and other similar things across the supply chain. We have almost-fully-automated factories already.",

    "Currently too high overhead. I think low-latency applications like real-time responding to your hand/eye/body movements will work well enough with small models, and the latency advantage will mean that just doing it locally is competitive.",
    "I already use ollama-ui, lately with qwen2.5-14b. It works great!",
    "There's sometimes valid UX gains from doing things like this, but it really should be locally running AI running on your own machine with data never leaving the device... this is why &lt;d/acc&gt;",
    "Some tangentially related materials in the meantime: EIP for replacing identity (simplest precompile) with EVM code Discussion around removing ripemd160 and blake2f precompiles: EVM-MAX + SIMD as alternative way to speed up EVM,‚Ä¶",
    "The replacement EVM code would have equivalent behavior, it would just cost more gas. So apps would not break.",
    "ok now I am curious what the use case is! Also CC  (who wrote ), do you happen to know the exact stats for modexp usage on L1?",
    "The former. Yeah the gas cost increase will be like 10x+, that's fine. I don't think we should bother much with gas optimization; focus effort on correctness. The reality is that near-zero users use modexp, we should optimize the things that people actually use.",
    "Why? It would remove protocol complexity, by making those precompiles no longer part of the protocol.",
    "I think we should go further and replace the modexp precompile entirely with a piece of EVM code that has equivalent functionality. And so the same with every precompile that is seeing near-zero usage. Modexp has caused us enough consensus-failure-near-miss grief, let's kill it",
    "If ENS fully moves to namechain, verification config for namechain should be privileged and exist outside ENS.",
    "The answer should be exclusively the wallet. There are ~10 wallets, ~10000 dapps, wallets should do the general-purpose security work. We want to minimize the (developer effort and trust) load on dapps as much as possible.",
    "The language that the verification would be implemented in is EVM. Just like So you get standardization and sandboxing including time-limiting for free.",
    "1. Localism here is a measurement technique, not a goal. So the hope is that something that helps lots of people gets a lot of (direct or indirect) \"this contributed to X slightly\" signals from many places. 2. The way the game is set up, AI developers can train on any data,‚Ä¶",
    "Here's one for public goods funding! V1 definitely doesn't entirely remove elites, though in the future we could do some sortition scheme to select for jury from a large pool. CC",
    "Deep funding combines two ideas: 1. Value as a graph: instead of asking \"how much did X contribute to humanity?\", ask \"how much of the credit for Y belongs to X?\" 2. Distilled human judgement: an open market of AIs fills in all the weights, human jury randomly spot-checks them‚Ä¶",
    "You can also fund Notre Dame through land value tax (or vanilla property tax) on nearby land.",
    "ok wow Hunyuan is great. Here's a bullpost. Great job  and big thanks for making the model open-weights!",
    "Gas coming from the same wallet as the tx is still most efficient. One signature instead of two, and fewer storage reads/writes. I expect the optimum is to use cross-L2 gas payment for one-offs, but once you use a chain a few times, send a few million gas worth of gwei there.",
    "ARS/USD is at exactly the same level as it was one year ago. Quite an impressive turnaround for a currency that was previously on a seemingly unstoppable road to hyperinflation. Inflation rates have also been decreasing quickly in recent months.",
    "Light clients as a concept were meant to approximate the safety level of a full client. So in contexts where full clients have no safety (eg. unbonded centralized sequencer preconfs), no surprise that light clients also have no safety. So intuitively I feel like it's not‚Ä¶",
    "Also on the topic of criticizing extreme elements of clusters we usually feel warmly towards (in my case here, internet libertarianism), it's worth remembering that exists",
    "One of those two numbers is semiprime, the other is kinda the opposite, it's quite smooth - in fact it's twice a primorial.",
    "This has been discussed extensively in recent posts:",
    "What's the largest semiprime you can factor?",
    "I don't think this is a fringe take at all. If Ethereum gave up on verifiability and accepted committees and centralized intermediaries for everything, I would consider it no longer Ethereum. In addition to verifiability I would also add highly democratized participation.",
    "Great job to  for remaining stable and supporting such a highly consequential application!",
    "Someone should figure out explicit credibly-neutral market incentives for aesthetics. eg. have a hot-or-not game where people are shown random buildings and upvote or downvote them, your property tax is proportional to the percent that downvote your building Let's make this fun",
    "Or why Singapore is clearly the inspiration for the city that appears in all the \"the amazing future if we did ______\" memes.",
    "I agree with this in principle, though in practice extensions are powerful and can basically turn a dumb browser into a smart browser. I hope  builds the functionality I describe into their built-in wallet.",
    "EIP-7702 will make the relevant Safe features available to all ethereum users, no?",
    "Regular reminder to L2s that are not you and  If you want to get mentioned in examples instead of me just ping-ponging between optimism and arbitrum over and over again, get to stage 1 (and have sufficient security audits to justify it). It's that simple. üòä",

    "New evolution timeline dropped: The elephants in the battles between Rome and Carthage were actually dinosaurs.",
    "You must choose one of the following: (i) B for sure (ii) X% chance you get A, 100-X % chance you die ---- In general, I think prose writing culture highly underrates programming-language-style syntactic sugar.",
    "Great work by all client teams on delivering client efficiency gains! I think it's wise to put the implied spare capacity into increasing blob count asap.",

    "Theoretical argument for this is pretty clear. Key question: is the thing that you want to intervene in something that itself becomes more complex over time due to improvements in human technology? If no, then the problem of usefully intervening in it will inevitably move along‚Ä¶",
    "Bit trex has refused to admit to their dino nature for far too long. I guess we have to come in and show the way.",
    "l2beat is one example of a good implementation. Nakamoto coefficients, Herfindahl index, etc, as a first-pass way of measuring one type of decentralization. We need a bunch more in the same spirit.",
    "If you optimize too hard for any specific single measurable objective you end up losing everything. Goodhart's Law is a powerful beast. Pluralism of goals and metrics is the best strategy that human civilization has come up with to keep it at bay.",
    "Video bull now! It's not as impressive as some of the recent AI videos, but we're supposed to be supporting open source here, and this is what the best open-weights models (this is pyramid flow) can do right now! Hopefully we can keep improving SotA of open-weights",
    "yeah I have a hard time seeing myself as anti-AI when I literally submitted two bug fixes to AI code in the past monthüòÑ",
    "Operative word is \"can\" - L2s don't have to be efficient at the cost of being fragile. Based rollups that make conservative tradeoffs are built for hard times too and can inherit almost all of the L1's benefits.",

    "Fundamentally, I expect state diffs and tx instructions to have similar entropy. Main practical difference is that tx signatures take a lot of space, and while you can snark it away you can't fault-prove a signature. But BLS (or other) signature aggregation can help!",
    "Many in the Ethereum ecosystem love Moodeng. Happy to also meet Moodeng's good friends at the zoo.",
    "The nuance behind nuance is that in an n-dimensional tradeoff space, there are ~2^sqrt(n) middle paths. You have to pick the right one. Merely saying \"we're the third thing\" is so underdetermined that it has at times stood for two nearly-opposite ideas, see eg. politics:",
    "DOPE Decentralization obligatory, practicality essential",
    "Left: e/acc OR \"AI safety via world government\" Right: euro-style decel Middle: d/acc",
    "Here's mine. This is the guiding principle behind all of my ideas, whether in consensus design, or in account abstraction / wallet design, or even beyond-ethereum topics like d/acc.",
    "We need to re-learn the idea of doing important collective projects without immediately defaulting to \"startup\" as the form factor. A startup is not the right form factor for every problem.",
    "One part of L2 scaling is Ethereum increasing its blob capacity. The other part is rollups becoming more data-efficient. Good to see  rising to the challenge. Would love to see more EVM rollups increasing data efficiency too (see )",
    "Your idea of a based rollup seems very different from mine? \"Based\" just means \"the L1 is your sequencer\", it says nothing about interop standards, you don't even have to be EVM.",
    "ZK-email as sole guardian should ONLY be a backstop solution for new users. Once someone becomes more experienced, wallet should push them to switch to M-of-N. N user-held private keys is ok, N institutional guardians via zk-wrappers is also ok. The ideal is a combo of both.",
    "Thank you for everything that you've done for Ethereum! It's been a long journey and your contributions have made Ethereum a stronger and more robust technology and ecosystem and helped hold it accountable to its principles. Hope that you can have a well deserved rest."
